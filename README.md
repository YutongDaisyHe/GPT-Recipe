# GPT Recipe

Welcome to the GPT Recipe project, an innovative autonomous agent designed to create personalized recipe books tailored to user preferences. GPT Recipe revolutionizes the way we discover and enjoy recipes by leveraging the power of AI to curate, write, design, and edit content based on individual tastes and interests.

## üîç Overview

GPT Recipe consists of seven specialized sub-agents in LangChain's new [LangGraph Library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph):

1. **Search Agent**: Scours the web for the latest and most relevant recipes.
2. **Curator Agent**: Filters and selects recipes based on user-defined preferences and interests.
3. **Writer Agent**: Crafts engaging and reader-friendly recipes.
4. **Critique Agent**: Provides feedback to the writer until the recipe is approved.
5. **Designer Agent**: Layouts and designs the recipes for an aesthetically pleasing reading experience.
6. **Editor Agent**: Constructs the recipe book based on the produced recipes.
7. **Publisher Agent**: Publishes the recipe book to the frontend or desired service.

Each agent plays a critical role in delivering a unique and personalized recipe book experience.
